function [p, s, t] = ntp_bottle_to_cast(Sppc, Tppc, P, k, sB, tB, pB, tolp) %#codegen
%NTP_BOTTLE_TO_CAST  Find the Neutral Tangent Plane from a bottle to a cast.
%
% [p, s, t] = ntp_bottle_to_cast(Sppc, Tppc, P, k, sB, tB, pB, tolp)
% finds a point on the cast with properties (s, t, p) that is neutrally 
% related to the bottle of (sB, tB, pB), meaning that
%   eos(s, t, p_avg) = eos(sB, tB, p_avg)
% is approximately solved (there is an exact solution within tolp of p),
% where eos is the equation of state given by eos.m in MATLAB's path,
% and   p_avg = (pB + p) / 2 is the average of the bottle's pressure
%                            and the pressure on the cast,
% and   [s,t] are the salinity and temperature on the cast at pressure p
%             given by ppc_val2(P, Sppc, Tppc, p).
% The cast's hydrographic properties are given by piecewise polynomial
% interpolants for salinity and temperature as functions of pressure,
% given by coefficient arrays Sppc and Tppc with knots at P(1:k). If no
% such (s, t, p) is found, each of (s, t, p) is NaN.
%
% For a non-Boussinesq ocean, P, pB, and p are pressure.
% For a Boussinesq ocean, P, pB, and p are depth.
%
%
% --- Input:
% Sppc [O, K-1]: coefficients for piecewise polynomial for practical / 
%     Absolute Salinity in terms of P on the cast.  Here, O is the
%     polynomial order and K is the number of data points (including NaN's)
%     on the cast.  These can be constructed using the `ppc_*` functions
%     in `neutral-surfaces/lib/ppc/`.
% Tppc [O, K-1]: as above but for potential / Conservative Temperature.
% P [K, 1]: pressure or depth data points on the cast.
% k [1, 1]: number of valid (non-NaN) data points on the cast.
%          Specifically, Sppc(:,1:k-1) and Tppc(:,1:k-1) must be non-NaN. 
% sB [1 , 1]: practical / Absolute salinity of current bottle
% tB [1 , 1]: potential / Conservative temperature of current bottle
% pB [1 , 1]: pressure or depth of current bottle
% tolp [1, 1]: tolerance for solving the level of neutral buoyancy (same
%              units as P and pB)
%
% Note: physical units for Sppc, Tppc, P, sB, tB, pB, p, s, t are
% determined by eos.m.
%
% Note: P must increase monotonically along its first dimension.
%
%
% --- Output:
% p [1, 1]: pressure or depth in the cast 
%           that is neutrally related to the bottle
% s [1, 1]: practical / Absolute salinity in the cast
%           that is neutrally related to the bottle
% t [1, 1]: potential / Conservative temperature in the cast
%           that is neutrally related to the bottle
